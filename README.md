# Handwritten Digit Recognition [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/delas/hdr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/delas/hdr)

Origionally from: https://github.com/delas/hdr

I updated it to to suite my needs, cleaned some stuff up, and converted much of it to english.

TO run:

> $ mkdir build

> $ mkdir data

Download [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) into data direcotry and unpack.

> $ make

Execute

This University project, aims to experiment with Neural Networks technology. The objective, as the name said, is the recognition of handwitten digit.

An example of the recognized digits is:

As Neural Networks library I used [FANN library](http://leenissen.dk/fann/) (Fast Artificial Neural Networks), in its origial C version: a great project. A great thank to all authors.
